        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A traditional South Asian dish composed of rice and chicken. It is crafted with an array of spices to bring a rich flavour to the otherwise simple composition. You'll find variations of Biryani all across the Indian subcontinent, from Pakistan to Bangladesh, Afghanistan to India. There are 2 main types - one where the protein and/or vegetables are cooked mixed throughout the rice, and the other version known as Hyderabad-style biryani in India where meat and rice are layered and cook in a sealed pot over fire. The latter is the style of biryani I'm sharing today.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Chicken thighs</li>
            <li>Yoghurt</li>
            <li>Onions</li>
            <li>Various spices, cardamom, cinnamon, turmeric, etc.</li>
            <li>White Rice</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Marinate chicken thighs in spiced yoghurt in a large pot, then layer with fried onions, fresh coriander/cilantro, then par boiled lightly spiced rice.</li>
            <li>The crowning glory is to finish it off with a drizzle of saffron infused water to give it the signature patches of bright yellow rice, as well as ghee (or melted butter) for buttery richness.
            </li>
            <li>The pot is then covered and cooked over a low heat for about 25 minutes during which time the rice absorbs the aromas and flavours of the curry underneath, whilst still being beautifully fluffy.</li>
        </ol>
