This is a project in which I have created a website consisting of a main page linking to recipes, built using purely HTML. 
The skills I have demonstrated in this project include:

    - Working with text
    
    - Use of lists
    
    - Use of links and Images
    
    - The ability to create meaningful commits/commit messages
